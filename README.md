 <p></p></line>From a simple, static HTML website to a dynamic, large-scale web application, Azure App Service Web Apps brings together everything you need to quickly deploy and run web apps using the language of your choice. This platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering lets you focus on your business logic while we take care of the infrastructure to run and scale your apps.</p>
<b></b><h3>Prerequisites:</h3></b>
•	Code repository

•	Language and framework-specific tooling


Why use Web Apps:
•	I have Develop in your favourite language and run with ease on Windows .
•	Deploy updates easily by using built-in CI/CD capabilities with GitHub, Azure DevOps Services, and more.
•	Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress.
•	Scale manually or automatically by applying pre-configured rules.
•	Easily add a custom domain or SSL certificates.
